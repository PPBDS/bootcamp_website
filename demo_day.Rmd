title: "Proceedures for Demo Day"

This is a rough draft of the proceedures we follow on "Demo Day," the last class during which students present their final projects.

The only material you need for your presentation is a browser which can show both your project's webpage and your Github repo. We don't use Powerpoint or other nonsense. 

Basic idea is that all students are in two groups: A and B. A presents first. Each breakout room includes two students, an A and a B. (We will post the assignments.)

At the start, we are all in the main room. I offer introductions. I open the rooms. You move yourself to your assigned room. (Guests will also go to the room featuring the student they want to listen to.) Chat politely. I will then issue a Breakout Room message saying to start. The A student presents her work for 4 minutes. The B student asks a lot of questions. So do the guests. These questions often involve your code. You can answer them by showing the actual R code in your Github repo.

After three and a half minutes, I send a Message saying: 30 seconds left. At four minutes, I Message "Switch Rooms!"

Please switch rooms when I ask you to!

Student A stays in the room. Student B moves one room up. From room 6 to room 7, for example. (If you are the B student in the highest room, you move to room 1.) Then, Student A presents again.

After 40 minutes of this, the A students will have presented 7 or 8 times. Good stuff! I bring back everyone to the main room. Say a few words. And then we do the whole thing again, but with the B students presenting and staying put in the rooms. And now the A students move from room to room.
