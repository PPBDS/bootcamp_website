* We want some graphics, even an animation, on the main page. But we don't want it to take forever to knit that page. So, we should probably have a .R file which creates the graphics we want --- and saves the results as rds files --- and then have the index.Rmd read_rds those files and then display the graphics.

* We want the sign-up-for-the-email to be more prominent. We have the raw html which, I think, we need to include. It is in sign_up.html. But when I follow the instructions here:

It does not work. There is space for an image/thing, but the rectangle is empty.

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
