<!-- Code for Day 3. We allow them to make any plot they want. Does not have to be this one. (Indeed, overlapping densities would probably be better.) Anything "interesting" which looks at US heights and weights. End the class by putting the image up on Rpubs and cleaning it up, by, for example, removing everything from the YALM except the "output: html_document". They should have learned about code chunk options (but probably not enough). Highlight the need for code comments and figure labels. -->

<!-- Need a better listing of possible plots, more closely connected to what was actually taught in the tutorials. -->
