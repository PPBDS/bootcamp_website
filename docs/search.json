      "contents": "\nTwo key resources: Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science and its associated tutorials. Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.\nCompleted tutorials are sent to kanes.datacamp@gmail.com with your name and the name of the tutorial (like “Sarah Jones; Getting Started”) in the subject line.\n\nWeek 1: Visualization\nLooking at the data is the first step in data science.\nRead Getting Started and follow all the associated instructions. We will do the Getting Started tutorial together in class.\nRead Chapter 1 Visualization. Complete the RStudio and Friends, Visualization A and Visualization B tutorials.\nRead How to use Rpubs. Complete Visualization C and Visualization D tutorials.\nOptional: Read and watch the videos from Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown by Chester Ismay and Patrick C. Kennedy\nWeek 2: Wrangling\nNow that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up data which might come to us quite messy.\nRead Chapter 2 Wrangling Data. Complete Wrangling A and Terminal tutorials.\nRead “How to Get Help” from the Appendix on Tools. Complete Wrangling B, C and D.\nRead the Style Guide.\nOptional: RStudio Essentials Videos. Most relevant for us are “Writing code in RStudio”, “Projects in RStudio” and “Github and RStudio”. Again, these are optional! But they are very useful for students who find traditional lectures to be a helpful supplement to classroom practice.\nWeek 3: Data\nNow that we know how to clean and organize messy data, we need to learn how to get some.\nRead Chapter 3 Data. Complete Data A tutorial.\nComplete Data Webscraping and Data API tutorials.\nRead Maps and IPUMS. Determine the data source you will use for your final project. Don’t come to class without one!\nWeek 4: Projects\nThe last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers. Further requirements and guidelines will be provided before the students begin their work.\nIntroduction to Distill. Complete the Distill tutorial and place a (rough!) graphic using the data for your final project in the #final-project Discord channel.\nPractice presentations and feedback. You must have your presentation ready to go!\nFinal project presentations. You must invite either your parents or someone else in your family.\nOptional: Distill for R Markdown is the main documentation page.

      "contents": "\nThis course is an excellent introduction to data science for students of any level, with a detailed textbook you can easily follow-along with! — Stephanie, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe data science course was an invaluable experience that provided me with the building blocks to pursue future data science investigations and analyses. The course was well-structured and taught me the fundamentals of not only producing stunning visualizations in R, but most importantly how to think like a data scientist and manage your code effectively. If you are someone interested in dipping their toes in an emerging field of data science, this course will guide you well! — Dhruv Syngol, Junior, Metea Valley High School\nThe learning environment was exceptional and encouraged me to navigate the basic challenges of RStudio with other students! It’s extremely effective for beginner individuals like me to gain this exposure! - Joyce Li, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe final project allowed me to draw from real world data about mental health disorders and learn how to make conclusions, moving me to be captivated by the data science field. —– Isaac Frank, Senior, Dublin Coffman High School\nThis course was really helpful! I learned a lot about data science and how to code in R. My favorite part were the breakout rooms since it allowed for students to share ideas and solve problems together. — Gabriel You (dengxuanjia@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe course tutorials were very informative and included an abundance of practice to ensure the material was understood. — Daniel Chen (danielc20051218@gmail.com), Junior, Naperville North High School\nThe course was an interesting way to learn the basics of data science, with the Final Projects being a great way to show what we grasped. — Oliver Raif Altindag (oliveraltindag@icloud.com), Freshman, Newton North High School\nGreat course overall. Introduces data science really well to people who may not have much knowledge about the field by showing important subjects such as data manipulation and visualization. Although some of the course content was slightly repetitive, it was still extremely effective in teaching students both basic and complex topics through the use of peer collaboration and the projects created at the end of the course. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to the language R and data science. — Abhay Paidipalli (abhay.paidipalli@gmail.com), Junior, James B. Conant High School\nBeing able to take part of a Harvard course, first of all, is such a valuable experience as you’re able to get a feel of the methodology that these elite institutions use. David Kane’s Data Science Boot camp was one of the most influential camps I’ve ever attended. Before this summer, I’ve never learned or touched a single piece of code and had no interest in programming, but after taking this course, it’s really made me fascinated in computer science, even going as far as planning to minor in cs. Working with Preceptor during the camp and under an apprenticeship really helped me gain valuable experience as well as sharpening skills in coding, critical thinking, and discipline. Also, it’s completely free. There’s so much to gain from this experience and nothing to lose. This camp is definitely one of the best offered to High school students and not one that you should pass on. — Bryan Li (libryan261@gmail.com/ 614-316-1061), Senior, Dublin Coffman High School\nThis course was valuable in helping me manage my time during school. Although I did not have any previous experience in R and Rstudio I had to learn to balance my school work and extracurriculars while meeting the demands of the course. — Joseph Jeiwan Kim (josephjwkim04@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks High School\nThis course does a fantastic job of not only putting you in the shoes of a student, learning the underlying coding and statistics, but also putting you in the shoes of a worker, doing real Data Science as a real Data Scientist. — George, senior, White Oaks Secondary School\n\n\n\n",
