* We want some graphics, even an animation, on the main page. But we don't want it to take forever to knit that page. So, we should probably have a .R file which creates the graphics we want --- and saves the results as rds files --- and then have the index.Rmd read_rds those files and then display the graphics.

* We want the sign-up-for-the-email to be more prominent. We have the raw html which, I think, we need to include. It is in sign_up.html. But when I follow the instructions here:

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/include-html.html

It does not work. There is space for an image/thing, but the rectangle is empty.

* Time to start re-organizing the tutorials!

* Need to figure out the relevant readings for week 4, mainly devoted to distill, but also, perhaps, to project organization. And Github pages. Would also be nice to have three or four example distill projects to show students.


Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
