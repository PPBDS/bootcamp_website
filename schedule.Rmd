Classes run from 8:00 to 9:00 PM EDT.

Two key resources: [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) and its [associated tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/). Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.

Completed tutorials are sent to kanes.datacamp@gmail.com with your name and the name of the tutorial separated by a semi-colon  --- like "Sarah Jones; Getting Started" --- in the subject line. If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *rds* format. If you want to save a copy for your own records, use *html*. 

# Week 1: Visualization

Looking at the data is the first step in data science.

## Monday July 25

* Read [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html) and follow all the associated instructions. We will do the Getting Started tutorial together in class.

## Wednesday July 27

* Read [Chapter 1 Visualization](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/visualization.html). 

* Complete the two Visualization tutorials: Basic Plots and Tidyverse.

## Thursday July 28

* Complete R Studio and Friends tutorial.

* Complete the two Visualization tutorials: Advanced Plotting and Case Studies.

* Read [How to use Rpubs](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html#how-to-use-rpubs). 

Reminder: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

* **Optional:** Read and watch the videos from [Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/) by Chester Ismay and Patrick C. Kennedy

# Week 2: Wrangling

Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up data which might come to us quite messy.

## Monday August 1

* Read [Chapter 2 Wrangling Data](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/wrangling.html). 

* Complete two Wrangling tutorials: Overview and Plots.

## Wednesday August 3

* Read "How to Get Help" from the Appendix on [Tools](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html). 

* Complete Getting Help tutorial.

* Complete remaining two Wrangling tutorials: More Plots and Statistics.

## Thursday August 4

* Complete Terminal tutorial.

* Read the [Style Guide](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html#style-guide). 

* **Optional:** [RStudio Essentials Videos](https://resources.rstudio.com/wistia-rstudio-essentials-2). Most relevant for us are [“Writing code in RStudio”](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/), [“Projects in RStudio”](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) and [“Github and RStudio”](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/). Again, these are optional! But they are very useful for students who find traditional lectures to be a helpful supplement to classroom practice. The Workflow tutorial is also optional.


# Week 3: Data

Now that we know how to clean and organize messy data, we need to learn how to get some.

## Monday August 8

* Read [Chapter 3 Data](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/data.html). 

* Complete Data - Files and  Distill tutorial. .


## Wednesday August 10

* Complete Data - AP, and Data - Webscraping tutorials.

## Thursday August 11

* Complete Tables tutorial.

* Read [Maps](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/maps.html) and [IPUMS](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/ipums.html). Determine the data source you will use for your final project. Don't come to class without one!

* Complete Downloading Census Data and Mapping tutorials.


# Week 4: Projects


The last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers.


## Monday August 15

* Place a (rough!) graphic using the data for your final project in the #final-project Discord channel.

* Practice presentations and feedback. You must have your presentation ready to go! 

## Wednesday August 17

## Thursday August 18

* Final project presentations. You must invite either your parents or someone else in your family.

* **Optional:** [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) is the main documentation page. Key sections are [Creating a Website](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) and [Publishing Websites](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/publish_website.html).
